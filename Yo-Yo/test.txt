Am I sorry your sky went black, put your knives in babies backs?
Am I sorry you killed the Kennedy's and Huxley too?
But I'm sorry Shakespeare was your scapegoat and your apples sticking into my throat.
Sorry your Sunday smiles are rusty nails and your crucifixion commercials failed.
But I'm just a pitiful anonymous.
And I see all the young believers.
Your target audience.
I see all the old deceivers.
We all just sing their song.
Am I sorry to be alive putting my face in the beehive?
Am I sorry for Booth and Oswald, pinks and cocaine too?
I'm sorry you never check the bag in my head for a bomb and my halo was a needle hole.
I'm sorry I saw a priest being beaten and I made a wish.
But I'm just a pitiful anonymous.
And I see all the young believers.
Your target audience.
I see all the old deceivers.
We all just sing their song.
We all just sing their song.
The valley of death we are free your father's your prison you see.
And I see all the young believers.
Your target audience.
I see all the old deceivers.
We all just sing their song.
You're just a copy of an imitation.
You're just a copy of an imitation.
President is dead.
Let us pray.
